Notes about ArduIMU Quadcopter configuration...

ESC setup
 - I connected only one ESC BEC (red wire) to the ArduIMU, the other 3 ESC´s only use two wires(white and black). 
   I made this on the male servo connector. Only one connector has 3 pins, the other has 2 pins (remove the central pin)
 - All ESC´s must have the same throttle range (I adjusted manually)
 - I change the timing to "Normal" setup (don´t use Hard timing)

ArduIMU programming
 - Be sure the main Quad battery is Disconnected.
 - I disconnect the ESC with the BEC to programm the ArduIMU. If you don´t do this you hear some "strange" beeps from ESC´s...

Radio setup
 - You should put the number of channels to read "#define MAX_CHANNELS 4". This depends on your configuration (I think that with 
   PPM encoder this should be 7). If this number is not correct you see that the radio values that appears on start are bad
   so try again...

IMU setup 
 - We have to take the offset values for the IMU sensors. Put the IMU flat and read the values that appear on screen. 
   To take acc_offset_z value you should put the IMU at 90º (or substract g_value to the flat z reading...)
 - Adjust Gyro gains (you can adjust first yaw gyro gain and then you should use OUTPUTMODE=0 to adjust roll and
   pitch gyro, see ArduIMU info...)

QUAD PID gains
 - The gains depends on quad size, motor, weight... so take this values as a first approach.

Please be carefull, quadcopters are not toys...
